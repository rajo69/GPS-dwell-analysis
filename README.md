Python Notebook

Dependencies:
math
pandas
datetime
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn
plotly
folium

How to run:
1) Download the folder 'GPS-dwell-analysis' from this repository.
2) Download anaconda navigator and open jupyter notebook from the folder just downloaded 'GPS-dwell-analysis'.
3) Open the notebook 'GPS_Dwell_Analysis_V1.1.ipynb' and run each cell sequentially.

Data analysis report:
In the repository folder as 'Analysis_Report_V1.1.pdf'

Aditional files:
Plot of location data on the map of Greater London Area:
'london_heatmap.html'
'london_heatmap_duration.html'

NOTE:
My computer is lagging due to the volume of data, given more compute power, I can do even more extensive analysis of the dwell pattern and user location.
I have done further analysis of the location data which I have uploaded in this repo as 'GPS_Dwell_Analysis_V1.2.ipynb', but was uploaded at 14:35Hrs on 3rd March 2024.
I have also uploaded an updated report of the analysis as 'Analysis_Report_V1.3.pdf' where I have fixed some typos.
Thank you for reviewing my work!
